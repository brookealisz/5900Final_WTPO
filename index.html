        <p>2019. Hand-drawn animation: watercolor. 1 minute and 55 seconds. Moving Image at Ohio State University. <br><br>Vulnerability is innately human. So innately human that I feel as though it is often overused in order to illicit sympathy. Therefore, I am interested in redefining it. 

I am choosing to represent imagery of vulnerability through repetitive action. Showing an action over and over may do one of two things: reinforce it or numb the viewer to it. I believe the reaction which takes place is up to the viewer and varies from person to person. I want to give this power to my audience so as to communicate that my work is vulnerable to their interpretation regardless of the content or narrative. So many viewers feel afraid to project their perspective into a sensitive piece so as to not oversee or overstep onto the emotions of the artist. But rather, I would like to invite my audience to interpret my vulnerability into their own thoughts and feelings. I hope this piece may create countless narratives within the eyes of an audience; I am vulnerable to interpretation. <br><br> Frame-by-frame animation is a method of filmmaking that I have been excited by since my childhood. Having taught myself basic Photoshop in elementary school, I had attempted my first at a young age. Terrible though it was, it opened my eyes to the fact that raw talent is not enough to be a good animator. Since having a few phenomenal teachers at Ohio State, I understand the amount of expertise that goes into animating: the physics, the exaggeration, and the timing to name a few areas that require acute attention. 

I spent two years of my time at Ohio State in an A Cappella group called Majors &amp; minors. Some of my best moments were spent with this  group, and some life long friends were made. We created an arrangement of Billie Eilish’s “When the Party’s Over” and I performed the solo. I chose to record myself singing the solo as well as four other voice parts (such as Alto 2, Soprano 1, Tenor, Bass) to create a version entirely sung by myself. This audio then was used to dictate the timing and emotion for this piece. </p>
